I am Yuhan Xu, a dynamic Master's student in Landscape Architecture at [Southeast University](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/main.psp), China. My primary research pursuits center around the synergy between urban development and environmental sustainability. I am particularly drawn to interdisciplinary studies, leveraging advanced techniques such as machine learning algorithms and deep learning framework. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge to contribute to meaningful projects and collaborative initiatives in the realm of urban planning and sustainability.

My recent publication, "Examining the rationality of Giant Panda National Park's zoning designations and management measures for habitat conservation," showcases my commitment to spatial governancehabitat and conservation using interpretable machine learning methods ([Science of The Total Environment, 170955](https://yuhanxu.top/publication/2024-02-13-paper)).

My research interests span diverse topics, including urban vitality, urban transportation, social equity, and public space perception. This multifaceted approach reflects my holistic exploration of the intricate connections between the built environment and societal well-being.
