Hello, I am Yuhan Xu, a dynamic and self-motivated Master's student in Landscape Architecture at the [School of Architecture, Southeast University](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/main.psp), China. My research focuses on environmental planning, sustainable development, and urban ecology, utilizing GIS techniques, spatial statistics, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning frameworks. I am particularly drawn to interdisciplinary studies, working with urban big data, built and natural environment data, street view images, and satellite data. My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as *Science of the Total Environment*, *Habitat International*, and *Sustainable Cities and Society*. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a strong background in urban design and landscape planning. As a graduate student, I actively participated in practical projects, such as the *General Plan for Mount Tianmu Scenic Area (2022-2035)*, where I gained insights into the conflicts between environmental protection and economic development under the guidance of Associate Professor [Jun Tang](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/2019/1116/c41171a410236/page.htm). I also contributed to landscape architecture in several urban design competitions, broadening my perspective through interdisciplinary discussions. These experiences have inspired me to pursue interdisciplinary research that explores the synergy between urban development and environmental sustainability. I am particularly interested in addressing eco-socio-economic trade-offs and driven by a commitment to translating academic knowledge into practical applications to promote urban sustainability and social justice.
