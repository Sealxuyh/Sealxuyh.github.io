Hello, I am Yuhan Xu, a dynamic and self-motivated Master's student in Landscape Architecture at the [School of Architecture, Southeast University](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/main.psp), China. My research focuses on environmental planning, sustainable development, and urban ecology, utilizing geographic information system (GIS) techniques, spatial statistics, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning frameworks. I am particularly drawn to interdisciplinary studies, working with urban big data, built and natural environment data, street view images, and satellite images. My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as *Science of the Total Environment* and *Sustainable Cities and Society*. 

My recent publication, "Examining the rationality of Giant Panda National Park's zoning designations and management measures for habitat conservation: Insights from interpretable machine learning methods," integrates species distribution models with interpretable machine learning methods to analyze the effects of environmental and anthropogenic factors on giant panda habitat distribution ([Science of The Total Environment, 170955](https://yuhanxu.top/publication/2024-02-13-paper)). This study reveals significant conflicts between human activities and protected areas and provides recommendations for effective zoning and management.

Currently, my research focuses on the application of ecosystem service concepts and environmental economics methods to promote urban sustainability.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a solid background in urban design and landscape planning. During my time as a graduate student, I have actively engaged in various practical projects, particularly under the mentorship of Aassociate Professor [Tang Jun](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/2019/1116/c41171a410236/page.htm). Notable projects include involvement in two comprehensive plans for scenic areas, a category of protected areas in China, where I gained a profound understanding of the inherent conflicts between environmental protection and economic development. I also contributed to the landscape architecture components of several urban design competitions, broadening my perspective by participating in interdisciplinary discussions.

These practical experiences have equipped me with valuable insights that motivate me to conduct interdisciplinary studies exploring the synergy between urban development and environmental sustainability. I am interested in figuring out how planning can address the trade-offs and potential conflicts, and I am driven by a desire to transfer knowledge from academia to real-world applications, truly integrating practice and research. My ultimate aim is to harmonize the often conflicting goals of environmental conservation and economic development, fostering both eco-environmental and socio-economic well-being for human society.
