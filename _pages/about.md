Hello, I am Yuhan Xu, a dynamic and self-motivated Master's student in Landscape Architecture at the [School of Architecture, Southeast University](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/main.psp), China. My research focuses on environmental planning, sustainable development, and urban ecology, utilizing GIS techniques, spatial statistics, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning frameworks. I am particularly drawn to interdisciplinary studies, working with urban big data, built and natural environment data, street view images, and satellite data. My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as *Science of the Total Environment*, *Habitat International*, and *Sustainable Cities and Society*. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a solid background in urban design and landscape planning. During my time as a graduate student, I have actively engaged in various practical projects, particularly under the mentorship of Associate Professor [Jun Tang](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/2019/1116/c41171a410236/page.htm). Notable projects include involvement in *General Plan for Mount Tianmu Scenic Area (2022-2035)*, where I gained a profound understanding of the inherent conflicts between environmental protection and economic development. I also contributed to the landscape architecture components of several urban design competitions, broadening my perspective by participating in interdisciplinary discussions.

These research and practical experiences have equipped me with valuable insights that motivate me to conduct interdisciplinary studies exploring the synergy between urban development and environmental sustainability. I am interested in figuring out how planning can address eco-socio-economic trade-offs, and I am driven by a desire to transfer knowledge from academia to real-world applications, truly integrating practice and research. My ultimate aim is to promote urban sustainability and enhance social justice.
