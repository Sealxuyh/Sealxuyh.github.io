I am Yuhan Xu, a dynamic and self-motivated Master's student in Landscape Architecture at [School of Architecture, Southeast University](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/main.psp), China. My primary research pursuits center around the synergy between urban development and environmental sustainability. I am particularly drawn to interdisciplinary studies, leveraging advanced techniques such as machine learning algorithms and deep learning framework. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge to contribute to meaningful projects and collaborative initiatives in the realm of urban planning and sustainability.

My recent publication, "Examining the rationality of Giant Panda National Park's zoning designations and management measures for habitat conservation: Insights from interpretable machine learning methods," showcases my commitment to spatial governance and habitat conservation using interpretable machine learning methods ([Science of The Total Environment, 170955](https://yuhanxu.top/publication/2024-02-13-paper)).

My research interests span diverse topics, including urban vitality, urban transportation, social equity, and public space perception. This multifaceted approach reflects my holistic exploration of the intricate connections between the built environment and societal well-being.

During my time as a graduate student, I have actively engaged in various practical experiences, particularly under the mentorship of Aassociate Professor [Tang Jun](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/2019/1116/c41171a410236/page.htm). Notable projects included my involvement in two comprehensive plans for scenic areas, where I gained a profound understanding of the inherent conflicts between conservation and development. These experiences have equipped me with valuable insights into my academic projects. Additionally, I contributed to the landscape architecture components of five urban design competitions, broadening my perspective by actively participating in interdisciplinary discussions. This exposure allowed me to appreciate the significance of cross-disciplinary collaboration in the field of planning. In essence, these valuable practical experiences also have fueled my desire to transfer knowledge from academia to real-world applications, aiming to truly achieve the integration of practices and researches.
