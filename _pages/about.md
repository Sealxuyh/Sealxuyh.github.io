Hello! I’m Yuhan Xu, a PhD student in [City and Regional Planning](https://planning.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. I am particularly interested in addressing urban weather extremes (e.g., heatwaves, flooding, wildfires) to help build resilient and equitable cities. I am working with Professor [Yiyi He](https://planning.gatech.edu/people/yiyi-he) as part of the [Resilient Futures Lab](https://yiyihe.xyz/).

My work leverages geospatial data analysis and advanced machine learning techniques to drive evidence-based solutions for sustainable urban development and environmental planning. My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals, including *npj Urban Sustainability*, *Habitat International*, and *Sustainable Cities and Society*.

Before joining Tech, I received my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in [Landscape Architecture]([https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/main.htm](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/DepartmentofLandscapeArchitecture/list.htm)) from Southeast University, China. I also worked as a research assistant in the  [Department of Urban Planning and Design](https://www.arch.hku.hk/departments-and-divisions/department-of-urban-planning-and-design/) at the University of Hong Kong, working with Professor [Tianren Yang](https://www.arch.hku.hk/staff/upad/yang-tianren/).

Beyond academia, I have extensive practical experience in urban design and environmental planning. As a graduate student, I contributed to the *General Plan for Mount Tianmu Scenic Area (2022-2035)* under the guidance of Professor [Jun Tang](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/2019/1116/c41171a410236/page.htm). Additionally, my participation in several urban design competitions, where interdisciplinary collaboration broadened my perspective and deepened my interest in the complex interplay within urban systems. I am committed to translating academic insights into real-world applications that foster the development of healthy and inclusive cities.
