Hello! Iâ€™m Yuhan Xu, a motivated and interdisciplinary-minded Master's student in Landscape Architecture at the [School of Architecture, Southeast University](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/main.psp), China. I am also a research assistant in the [Department of Urban Planning and Design](https://www.arch.hku.hk/programmes_/upad/) at the University of Hong Kong, working with Professor [Tianren Yang](https://www.arch.hku.hk/staff/upad/yang-tianren/). I am particularly interested in interdisciplinary studies that intersect urban planning, transportation, public health, and data science. My research leverages geospatial data analysis and advanced machine learning techniques to generate actionable insights and drive innovative, data-informed solutions that enhance sustainable urban development and improve public well-being. My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals, including *Science of the Total Environment*, *Habitat International*, and *Sustainable Cities and Society*.

Beyond academia, I have extensive practical experience in urban design and environmental planning. As a graduate student, I contributed to the *General Plan for Mount Tianmu Scenic Area (2022-2035)* under the guidance of Professor [Jun Tang](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/2019/1116/c41171a410236/page.htm). Additionally, my participation in several urban design competitions, where interdisciplinary collaboration broadened my perspective and deepened my interest in the complex interplay within urban systems. I am committed to translating academic insights into real-world applications that foster the development of healthy and inclusive cities.
