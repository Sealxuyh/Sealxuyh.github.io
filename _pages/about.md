Hello, I am Yuhan Xu, a dynamic and self-motivated Master's student in Landscape Architecture at the [School of Architecture, Southeast University](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/main.psp), China. I am particularly interested in interdisciplinary studies that intersect urban planning, transportation, public health, and data science. My research in environmental and urban planning leverages GIS techniques, spatial statistics, machine learning, and deep learning frameworks. My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as *Science of the Total Environment*, *Habitat International*, and *Sustainable Cities and Society*. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a strong background in urban design and environmental planning. As a graduate student, I contributed to practical projects such as the *General Plan for Mount Tianmu Scenic Area (2022-2035)*, guided by Professor [Jun Tang](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/jz_en/2019/1116/c41171a410236/page.htm). I also participated in several urban design competitions, where interdisciplinary collaboration broadened my perspective and deepened my interest in the intersection of urban development and environmental sustainability. I am dedicated to translating academic insights into real-world applications, promoting urban sustainability, and enhancing human well-being.
