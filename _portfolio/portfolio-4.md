In response to the emerging concept of Cyberfeminism, distinct from traditional values, our project utilizes a virtual and digital network cultural communication platform to dismantle barriers of region, race, and culture. Cyberfeminism elevates the symbiotic relationship between women, computers, and the Internet to an ideological level, manifesting through both virtual and real-world practices.

Taking inspiration from Li Ziqi, a Chinese female vlogger who set a Guinness World Record for 'the most YouTube Chinese channel subscriptions,' our project shifts its focus to the realities of women living in Scampia. Data analysis reveals that employed women exhibit lower inequality indices within their families.

Guided by cyberfeminist principles, our aim is to provide local women with a platform to showcase Italian characteristic food culture and their daily lives using the Internet and digitization as tools. Situated in the central park of Scampia, our project establishes a close connection with the surrounding community. As landscape designers, our focus is on creating various spaces such as an edible landscape, event square, rain garden, kitchen, restaurant, and meeting square. The urban agricultural park empowers local women to produce high-quality short videos, generating online awareness and financial income to achieve female empowerment.
