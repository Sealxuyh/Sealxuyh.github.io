Amidst the evolution of urban development and technological advancements, a spectrum of pollution issues has arisen, notably the escalating concern of light pollution due to human activities. Light pollution encompasses various lights that disrupt the natural environment, adversely affecting daily life, work, relaxation, and recreation, ultimately impairing observational abilities and human health. Internationally, light pollution is categorized into white light pollution, color light pollution, and artificial daylight.

The genesis of light pollution lies in human apathy towards the celestial beauty, resulting in the indiscriminate use of various light sources. The Dark Night Park, endorsed globally by the International Dark-Sky Association, advocates for urgent strategies to curb global light pollution. In areas above the city, where only sporadic stars are visible, this initiative allows people to witness hundreds of stars, even meteor showers, fostering a profound connection with the cosmos.

The twinkle of the starry sky is not merely a facet of nature but also a vital component of human culture. This memorial landscape design is situated in the Ali Dark Night Reserve, virtually untouched by light pollution, and embraces a rich pilgrimage culture. Pilgrimage involves a journey to a sacred place or other significant locations, aiming to rekindle people's inner reverence for the starry sky. By creating a pilgrimage to the starry sky, the design seeks to inspire awe, encourage a return to the pristine dark night environment, and elevate environmental consciousness.
