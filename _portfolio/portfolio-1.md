# Academic Project: Urban Design

**Duration:** August 2021 - October 2021  
**Location:** Qinhuai District, Nanjing City, China  
**Instructor:** Hongfei Ji  
**Type:** Individual Work  
**Skills:** Rhino, Indesign, Photoshop, Illustrator  

In response to the industrial revolution's impact on climate change and ecological crises, carbon neutrality has emerged as a global imperative. Road traffic contributes 16% of greenhouse gas emissions, while building heating and cooling add 7%.

This project, conducted at regional and plot scales, aims to optimize green spaces, transportation, and buildings to reduce carbon emissions, enhance absorption, and achieve carbon neutrality.

## 1. Regional Scale:
- **Urban Interface and Ecological Interface Expansion:** Enlarging the intersection of urban and ecological interfaces.
- **Traffic Optimization:** Overhauling road layouts, implementing a slow-moving system, and minimizing motorized traffic trips.
- **Land Use Planning:** Creating a multi-center network with a primary center and two sub-centers.

## 2. Plot Scale:
- **Mixed-Use Development:** Incorporating moderately high-density mixed-use land with three types of composite small blocks: residential + commercial, residential + commercial + industrial, and residential + commercial + industrial + agricultural.
- **Building Design:** Advocating high-rise development to reduce carbon emissions per capita, with high-rise residential areas of moderate density identified as having the lowest carbon emissions.
- **Carbon Reduction Technologies:** Implementing green roof systems, vertical greening initiatives, and integrating photovoltaic roofing.
- **Carbon Sink Integration:** Creating an ecological network seamlessly connected to the urban carbon sink system within the plot.

This project adopts a holistic approach to sustainable urban design, addressing climate challenges through thoughtful planning and innovative technologies.
