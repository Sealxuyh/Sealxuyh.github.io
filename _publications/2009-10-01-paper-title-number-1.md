excerpt: '• A species distribution model was constructed based on the random forest algorithm.
• Interpretable machine learning revealed the impact mechanisms of variables.
• Areas where conflicts exist were identified through overlay analysis.
• Our methods can be used for other data-poor national parks or protected areas.'
